# Bonfire - A web based chat client for twitch

Bonfire is a web based chat client for twitch chats. It is still under heavy development and **not recommended for general use yet**.

You can either use the website version under chats.c0ldplasma.de or download the deskop app based on electron under releases.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of Bonfire up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Installing

First install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), then run the following commands in console:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/c0ldplasma/bonfire
cd bonfire
npm install
```

You can use any IDE like Visual Studio Code or WebStorm for coding. The following commands can be used to continuously build the src/*.js files to the public/bundle.js file while coding. Recommended: `npm run dev`.

The `public/index.html` file contains a `<script src='bundle.js'>` tag, which means we need to create `public/bundle.js`. The `rollup.config.js` file tells Rollup how to create this bundle, starting with `src/main.js` and including all its dependencies, including [date-fns](https://date-fns.org).

`npm run build` builds the application to `public/bundle.js`, along with a sourcemap file for debugging.

`npm start` launches a server, using [serve](https://github.com/zeit/serve). Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

`npm run watch` will continually rebuild the application as your source files change.

`npm run dev` will run `npm start` and `npm run watch` in parallel.

## Deployment

### Website

To host it yourself on a server you need to create your own ClientID through the Twitch development website ( https://dev.twitch.tv/console/apps ) and enter the URL where the website is deployed. After that replace ClientID and the URL in src/app/TwitchConstants.js

After that build it with `npm run build`

Then copy the public folder content to your webroot and check if your php is configured correctly so that the php/recentMessages.php is working. It is used for loading the recent chat messages from the inofficial twitch api which is not directly accessible from client side because of cross domain policies.

### Desktop App

1. Download a copy of [Electron](https://github.com/electron/electron/releases) for your platform.
1. Extract it.
1. Put the desktop_app/app folder as a whole in the electron/resources folder.
1. In the electron/resources/app/index.html you can change the URL to your own instance of Bonfire at line 92.

## Built with
